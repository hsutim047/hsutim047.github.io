I am applying to MS programs in CS!

Hi! I am Tsu-Yuan. I received my B.S. from [NTU CSIE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) in June this year. Currently, I am working on speech conversion throught text instructions, advise by wonderful Prof. [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php).

Prior to this, my undergraduate reserach focused on foundation models. I worked with Prof. Lee on speech SSL models. I was also fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yun-Nung Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/) to work on multimodal models.
